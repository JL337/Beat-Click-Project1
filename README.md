# Beat-Click-Project1
Beat!Click Rythym Game 
(HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery) 
- Sparta Global/Project 1/W3 D1-D5

A beat rythym browser game created with HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.


## Purpose
The aim of this project was to build a **browser based game** using only HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. This would be compeleted from scratch within five days, and would involve two sprints. 

## Functionality

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible within a given time frame. In order to to this, the player must click with the mouse, in time to the background music. When the outer circle meets the inner circle, they should click on the inner circle. This earns the player points depending on accuracy of the click. 

If the player reaches a threshold on ("MISS CLICK"), then the game ends. The game also ends when the audio duration of the music reaches 00:00.

Input data is obtained from the mouse. Additionally DOM manipulation was used, with JQuery, to change the HTML elements within the game. Some mathematical calculations were used to calculate the BPM and interval delays in order to match the outer circle in time to each song. (See *Audio* directory for list of songs used)

## Implementation

The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.7
* JQuery 3.2.1
* Javascript 
* Semantic HTML5
* HTML5 Audio
* CSS
